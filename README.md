# To-Do-App-Using-Python
This is a To-Do App which I have made using Python. As you can see it is not a simple Python program , I have used third party Python Package called 
FreeSimpleGUI , it acts as a FrontEnd for my program. 

I have uploaded 3 files cli.py[BACKEND], gui.py[FRONTEND] and functions.py[FUNCTIONS].

The graphical user interface appears on the screen when you run the program. We have ADD , EDIT , COMPLETE and EXIT button.
You can add a To-DO task , edit it and complete it.

If you have not selected any to-do and click on either EDIT or CONFIRM button , it will show a pop-up window stating that,
"Select an Item First".

I have also made 2 executable files for Windows and Mac OS and gui.app.zip[WINDOWS] , Gui.app.zip[MAC OS] , you can also download and run them.
